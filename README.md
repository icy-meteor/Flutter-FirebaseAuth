# ðŸ”¥ Flutter - Firebase Auth (Easy-to-use!)

This allows you to seamlessly integrate Firebase Authentication into your Flutter project without having the trouble to manage different Authentication states in different pages of your application. 

The Auth class abstracts the complexity and encapsulates the methods into a single unit, allowing developers to leverage complete functionality of Firebase.

# Getting Started

 1. Import ***auth.dart*** file into your Flutter Project
 
 2. Create an object for the BaseAuth class :
     `BaseAuth auth`
 
 3. Call the methods using the object within ***initState()*** method 
    
   ```
BaseAuth auth;

enum AuthStatus 
{
  notSignedIn,
  signedIn,
}

class XYZ{
....*insert code*.....

void initState() {      
 auth.currentUser().then((userId) { 
      setState(() {
        authStatus =
            userId != null ? AuthStatus.signedIn : AuthStatus.notSignedIn;
      });
     });
    }
  }
```

4. Tadaa!! Time to put your app to actionðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
